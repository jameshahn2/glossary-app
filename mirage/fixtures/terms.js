Up to 20 wt % of CMC may be NaCl, a by-product of manufacture, but purified grades of CMC contain only small amounts of NaCl. To make CMC, OH groups on the glucose rings of cellulose are ether-linked to carboxymethyl (-OCH2-COO-) groups. (Note the negative charge.) Each glucose ring has three OH groups capable of reaction, degree-of-substitution = 3. Degree of substitution determines water <a class=\"text-blue-light no-underline\" href=\"/terms/s/solubility\">solubility</a> and negativity of the <a class=\"text-blue-light no-underline\" href=\"/terms/p/polymer\">polymer</a>, which influences a CMC's effectiveness as a <a class=\"text-blue-light no-underline\" href=\"/terms/m/mud_additive\">mud additive</a>. Drilling grade CMCs used in muds typically have degree-of-substitution around 0.80 to 0.96. Carboxymethylcellulose is commonly supplied either as low-viscosity (<a class=\"text-blue-light no-underline\" href=\"/terms/c/cmc-lo_vis\">CMC-Lo Vis</a>) or high-viscosity (<a class=\"text-blue-light no-underline\" href=\"/terms/c/cmc-hi_vis\">CMC-Hi Vis</a>) grades, both of which have <a class=\"text-blue-light no-underline\" href=\"/terms/a/api\">API</a> specifications. The viscosity depends largely on the molecular weight of the starting cellulose material.
